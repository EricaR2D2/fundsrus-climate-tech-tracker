*Climate Tech Funding Intelligence Platform*

## **Opening - Problem & User Story** (45 seconds)

**[Show FundsRUS dashboard on screen]**

"Hi everyone! I'm excited to present **FundsRUS** - a climate tech funding intelligence platform we built this week.

**The Problem**: Climate tech is exploding - over $50 billion invested last year - but finding the right investors is a nightmare for founders. The data is scattered across hundreds of sources, and founders waste weeks manually researching who funds what in their space.

**User Story**: Meet Sarah, a climate tech founder building an energy storage startup. She needs Series A funding but doesn't know which investors actually lead deals in her vertical, what their geographic focus is, or if they're actively investing in her stage. She's spending 40+ hours a week on investor research instead of building her product."

## **Solution & Value Demonstration** (90 seconds)

**[Navigate through the platform features]**

"That's where FundsRUS comes in. We transform scattered funding data into actionable intelligence.

**[Point to the three tabs]** Notice our clean, intuitive interface with three main sections: Investor Database, AI Assistant, and Glossary.

**[Click on Investor Database tab]** Let me show you the magic. Sarah can instantly search for competitors - **[type 'energy' in company search]** - and immediately see who funded them, when, and for how much.

**[Show the results]** Look at this - she instantly discovers that Brevan Howard Digital and Haun Ventures led a $20M Series A for Plume Network in the energy space.

**[Navigate to filters]** But here's where it gets powerful. Sarah can filter for **[click 'Lead Investors Only']** investors who actually write lead checks - not just followers. She can target her geography **[show geography filter]** and find stage-appropriate investors **[show deal size buckets]**.

**[Click on an investor profile]** When she clicks any investor, she gets their complete deal history, conviction signals, and investment patterns. This is intelligence that would take weeks to compile manually.

**[Click AI Assistant tab]** And here's our newest feature - our AI Assistant can extract funding data from any news article URL in real-time, keeping our database current."

## **Tech Stack & Architecture** (45 seconds)

**[Show code/architecture briefly]**

"From a technical perspective, we built this as a modern web application:

- **Frontend**: Streamlit for rapid prototyping and beautiful UI
- **Data Processing**: Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis  
- **AI Integration**: Google Gemini API for intelligent data extraction
- **Data Storage**: JSON for flexible, schema-less data management
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with gradient branding for professional appearance

The architecture is designed for scalability - we can easily integrate APIs, add real-time data feeds, and expand to multiple data sources."

## **Key Learning & Sprint Takeaways** (60 seconds)

"This week's sprint taught us several critical lessons:

**1. User-Centric Design Matters**: We started with a basic data table, but user feedback showed founders need conviction signals - like lead vs. follow behavior - not just raw data. So we pivoted to an investor-centric view.

**2. AI Integration is a Game-Changer**: Our AI Assistant feature went from concept to working prototype in 2 days. It can extract structured funding data from unstructured news articles - that's the future of data collection.

**3. Progressive Enhancement Works**: We launched with core functionality and added features incrementally - company search, advanced filters, geographic intelligence, and alphabetical navigation. Each addition made the platform more valuable.

**4. Data Quality is Everything**: We spent significant time cleaning and structuring our dataset. Good data architecture enabled all our advanced features.

**The Big Takeaway**: In just one week, we proved that AI can democratize access to funding intelligence. What used to take founders weeks of manual research now takes minutes."

## **Closing & Next Steps** (30 seconds)

"FundsRUS isn't just a tool - it's a competitive advantage for climate tech founders. We're already planning our next sprint: partner identification through NLP, LinkedIn integration for warm introductions, and real-time alerts when target investors make new deals.

The climate crisis needs solutions, and solutions need funding. FundsRUS is bridging that gap.

Thank you!"
